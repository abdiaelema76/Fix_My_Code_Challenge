## 0x00. Fix my code

## 0. FizzBuzz
fixed the placement of conditions since the condition for multiples of 3 and 5 was in the middle and
it was never reached because the condition for multiples of 3 was checked before it. to fix this issue 
we arranged the coditions so that the check for multiples of both 3 and 5 comes first

## 1. Print square
fixed ParseInt error which was initially  using base of 16 instead of default base 10
